Installing from scratch is for advanced users. You will need access to the terminal either directly or through ssh. Even though this is for advanced users it is a great way to learn how HOOBS and Homebridge works.

HOOBS has an install script that works for most RPM and DEB based Linux distributions. To install simply run this command from the terminal.

```bash
~]$ wget -q -O - http://bit.ly/get-hoobs | sudo bash -
```

The HOOBS install script will set everything up for you. Once HOOBS is installed, your device will automatically reboot.
