The HOOBS plugin screen allows you to install, update and remove plugins from the system.

HOOBS supports Homebridge plugins and adds HOOBS plugins too. We also have a HOOBS certified program which verifies that a plugin works and is easy to configure.

**Installed Plugins**

This is the main view for the plugins. It shows you what plugins are installed on the system.

If a plugin has a newer version published, you will see an **Update** button.

**Certified Plugins**

If you are having trouble finding a plugin that works? Browse the plugin catalog. These plugins are all HOOBS Certified.

We include an image typically associated with the plugin.

You can install a certified plugin by clicking on the plugin. The plugin details screen will show.

From here click on the **Install** button. If you already have this plugin installed you will see either an **Uninstall** or **Update** button.

**Installing a Plugin**

To install a plugin simply click on the **Install** button. This is available in the plugin list or the plugin details screen.

Once a plugin installs, it will show the configuration for that plugin.

**Searching**

We understand, sometimes we can't certify plugins fast enough. The good news is we support Homebridge plugins too.

You can use the search bar to find plugins that fit your needs. Simply start typing the name of the defice or system you want to add in the search bar.

> Trick. If you type `homebridge` in the search box, you will get the top 50 plugins sorted by popularity.
