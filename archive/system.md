The System screen has information about the software and the hardware HOOBS is running on.

From this screen you can.

* Check for HOOBS updates
* Get information about the **Operating System**
* Keep tabs on the **File System** and **Temprature**
* Access the **Terminal** for advanced operations

**Updating HOOBS**

This checks NPM for you, and if NPM has a version greater than what you have installed, it will show here.

To upgrade click the **Upgrade** button.

> Note. Upgrading requires sudo. If you are not running HOOBS with the **-p** flag, or you don't have sudo setup to not ask for passwords. This will not execute.

**Terminal**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoobs-org/HOOBS/master/docs/system/terminal.png)

The terminal is the command line for the device HOOBS is running on. This works on Linux and MacOS.

> If you don't know how to run commands on Linux, you should avoid this screen.
